Hi, my name is Raymond Pan and I am a first-year undergraduate student studying at MIT. 
I plan on majoring in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and have already taken a few introductory Programming course.
I like to practice coding in my free time and the coding I do can range from just learning a new language or trying to figure out a new API.
If you'd like to contact me, my email is raymondpan12345@gmail.com!
